# Campus Planner Assignment (Python)

This project implements a Campus Planning system using fundamental Data Structures and Graph Algorithms.  
It is written in **simple, readable Python** and includes:

---

## 📌 Features Implemented

### ✔ Building ADT  
Each building has:
- ID  
- Name  
- Details  

---

### ✔ Binary Search Tree (BST)  
Operations:
- Insert  
- Search  
- Inorder traversal  
- Height calculation  

---

### ✔ AVL Tree (Self-Balancing BST)  
Includes:
- Rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL)  
- Automatic height balancing  

Ensures `O(log n)` search and insert.

---

### ✔ Graph (Adjacency List)  
Buildings (nodes) connected with weighted paths (edges).

Includes:
- BFS (Breadth First Search)  
- DFS (Depth First Search)  
- Dijkstra Shortest Path  
- Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

---

### ✔ Expression Tree  
Evaluates arithmetic expressions in postfix notation.
